# AmICoinOrNot

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Description

**AmICoinOrNot** is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create and manage "meme coins" on the Base Sepolia testnet. Users can mint new tokens, associate them with an image, and potentially participate in a voting or leaderboard system. The primary goal is to explore and demonstrate the process of deploying custom tokens on a Layer 2 blockchain like Base.

## How to Run

First, ensure you have pnpm installed:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
